Q: Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6).
If so, determine if it’s an even number or odd number as well.

Ask the user to enter number(N).
Ask the user to enter another number(n).
Set X=n÷N 
Set Ans=n-2X
If Ans=0 then
    Display "N is a divisor of n"
Else 
    Display "N isn't divisor of n"
If N is perfectly divisible by 2 then
    Display "N is an even number"
Else
    Display "N is an odd number"
END
